# Datasets

This folder contains the dataset used by the mobile and desktop applications.

The dataset was exported to two formats:

- *indicators.geojson*: contains the indicators in the [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) format.

- *osm-format*: contains the indicators in the [OSM](https://docs.fileformat.com/gis/osm/) format. The file *osm-format/nodes.xml* contains the coordinates of each node and the definition of each way. The other files (*osm-format/\*.csv*) contain the indicator values for each way.
